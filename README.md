#This C++ program performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers. Using a switch statement, it executes the corresponding operation and displays the result. Division by zero is handled with a specific message. If an invalid operator is entered, it notifies the user. The program demonstrates basic input/output handling, conditional logic, and switch-case usage to perform calculations in a simple command-line interface.
